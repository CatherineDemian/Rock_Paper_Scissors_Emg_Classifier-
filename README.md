# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Emg_Classifier-
A machine learning project that uses EMG sensor data to classify hand gesturesâ€”rock, paper, and scissors. The system preprocesses raw EMG signals, trains an SVM model, and performs real-time classification of incoming EMG data.

To use our trained model readings download the readings.zip file andw for using the realtime sensor with Trigno Delsys Downloaded the pytrigno package in the repo which can be used as EMG , IMU or both.

All preprcocessing is applied to the data but only the time domain analysis were used in the model training.
